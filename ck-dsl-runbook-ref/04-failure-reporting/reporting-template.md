## 15. Reporting Template

Use this table for experiment logs:

| Variant | Hypothesis | Correct | Time | Throughput | VGPR | SGPR | LDS | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | reference | yes | | | | | | |
| v1 | change one lever | yes/no | | | | | | |

Use this final summary:

```text
Best correct variant:
  name:
  shape:
  latency:
  throughput:
  correctness:
  resources:

Main bottleneck now:
  evidence:

Rejected ideas:
  - idea: reason

Next experiments:
  1.
  2.
  3.
```

For published numbers, attach the manifest + HSACO + `analyze_hsaco`
output (or equivalently, the `probe_occupancy.py` and
`probe_isa_inspect.py` reports). See `measured_results.md` for the
last documented validation pass.

### 15.1 Minimum Result Record

For every experiment, record:

```text
kernel/spec name
shape
dtype/layout
GPU and ROCm version
baseline commit/config
variant description
correctness status
max/mean error
latency median
latency spread
TFLOPS or GB/s
VGPR/SGPR/LDS if inspected
notable ISA changes
notes
```

If correctness fails, do not report speed as a win.

### 15.2 Done Criteria For An Optimization

An optimization is done when:

- it has a one-sentence hypothesis;
- correctness passes representative and adversarial shapes;
- benchmark improvement is stable across repeated runs;
- generated IR / ISA confirms the intended primitive changed;
- resource usage is recorded;
- docs or comments explain the new invariant if it is non-obvious;
- unsupported configurations are rejected by validation.
