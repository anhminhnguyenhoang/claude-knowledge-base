## 1 · High-level intent

These four helpers are PID-preprocessing utilities that callers stick at the **very top** of a Triton kernel — *before* any compute — to re-permute the launch-order `program_id(0)` into a tile coordinate with good spatial locality on chiplet GPUs (MI300X/MI355X).

| Helper | Purpose | HipKittens Algorithm 1 |
|---|---|---|
| `remap_xcd_chunked(pid, GRID_MN, NUM_XCDS, CHUNK_SIZE)` | Force `CHUNK_SIZE` consecutive logical PIDs onto the same XCD | Phase 1 (knob *C*) |
| `remap_xcd(pid, GRID_MN, NUM_XCDS)` | Same idea with `CHUNK_SIZE = ceil(GRID/NUM_XCDS)` — each XCD gets one big run | Phase 1 at *C = max* (the L2-greedy extreme) |
| `pid_grid(pid, num_pid_m, num_pid_n, GROUP_SIZE_M)` | 1-D → 2-D unflatten; walk in vertical windows of height `GROUP_SIZE_M` | Phase 2 (knob *W*) |
| `pid_grid_3d(pid, num_pid_m, num_pid_n, num_pid_k)` | 1-D → 3-D unflatten for split-K (no chiplet awareness) | — |

The two phases compose: kernels typically do `pid = remap_xcd_chunked(pid, ...); pid_m, pid_n = pid_grid(pid, ...)`.

## 2 · Hardware context (one paragraph)

MI355X = 8 XCDs × 32 CUs × 4 MB private L2 per XCD, sharing one LLC above HBM. The HW dispatcher round-robins block IDs across XCDs: block *k* → XCD *k % 8*. Combined with row-major launch order, this scatters each XCD's work across the whole output (measured **55 % L2 hit rate** on 9216³ BF16 GEMM). The remap defeats round-robin by feeding the HW a permutation that puts overlapping work on the same XCD; the windowed traversal then walks that work in 2-D tiles so each window reuses both a row of A and a column of B.

## 3 · The math, in one screen

### `remap_xcd_chunked` — Phase 1

```python
# HW dispatch rule is fixed: block with id `new_pid` runs on XCD `new_pid % NUM_XCDS`.
# Goal: pick a `new_pid` such that CHUNK_SIZE consecutive *logical* pids land
# on the same physical XCD, defeating the round-robin scatter.

xcd          = pid % NUM_XCDS              # 1) which XCD HW would have run THIS pid on
                                           #    (= dealer label of the card we were dealt)

if pid > (GRID_MN // (NUM_XCDS*CHUNK_SIZE)) * (NUM_XCDS*CHUNK_SIZE):
    return pid                             # 2) tail guard: pids past the last full
                                           #    "cycle" of NUM_XCDS*CHUNK_SIZE pass through
                                           #    unchanged — remapping them would produce
                                           #    out-of-range or colliding new_pids.

local_pid    = pid // NUM_XCDS             # 3) my index inside MY XCD's private pid list.
                                           #    HW gives each XCD every NUM_XCDS-th pid, so
                                           #    XCD 1 sees pids [1, 9, 17, 25, ...]. For pid=17,
                                           #    local_pid = 17//8 = 2 → I'm at position 2 in
                                           #    XCD 1's list (the 3rd pid it has seen).
                                           #    This dense 0,1,2,3,... counter is what lets
                                           #    the next two lines reason about chunks.

chunk_idx    = local_pid // CHUNK_SIZE     # 4) which group of CHUNK_SIZE consecutive
                                           #    logical pids do I belong to? (chunks
                                           #    are numbered 0, 1, 2, ... globally)

pos_in_chunk = local_pid %  CHUNK_SIZE     # 5) my offset inside that chunk (0..CHUNK_SIZE-1)
                                           #    — this becomes the low bits of new_pid

return chunk_idx * NUM_XCDS * CHUNK_SIZE   # 6a) jump to the start of my chunk's "cycle"
                                           #     (each cycle is NUM_XCDS * CHUNK_SIZE pids wide,
                                           #     one chunk for every XCD)
     + xcd       * CHUNK_SIZE              # 6b) inside the cycle, jump to MY XCD's slot.
                                           #     This is the key step: because new_pid % NUM_XCDS
                                           #     will equal `xcd`, HW routes me to the same XCD
                                           #     the original `pid` already implied.
     + pos_in_chunk                        # 6c) inside my XCD's slot, take my offset.
                                           #     Together: consecutive logical pids in the same
                                           #     chunk get consecutive new_pids that all land
                                           #     on the same physical XCD.
```

Intuition: HW deals you a card (`pid`); you can see which dealer's pile it came from (`xcd`) and where in the pile (`local_pid`). The new ID glues piles into runs of `CHUNK_SIZE` cards, each fully inside one XCD.

### `pid_grid` — Phase 2

```python
if GROUP_SIZE_M == 1:                       # row-major baseline
    pid_m = pid // num_pid_n
    pid_n = pid %  num_pid_n
else:
    num_pid_in_group = GROUP_SIZE_M * num_pid_n
    group_id         = pid // num_pid_in_group
    first_pid_m      = group_id * GROUP_SIZE_M
    group_size_m     = min(num_pid_m - first_pid_m, GROUP_SIZE_M)
    pid_m = first_pid_m + (pid %  group_size_m)
    pid_n = (pid % num_pid_in_group) // group_size_m
```

Intuition: stack the output into horizontal strips of `GROUP_SIZE_M` rows; walk each strip column-by-column. Consecutive PIDs share a column of B; the strip bounds reuse of A's rows.

## 4 · ASCII: what each helper buys you

### Default round-robin (no helpers)

```
output tile grid (rows = pid_m, cols = pid_n), N=8
colour = XCD (= pid % 8)
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
0 [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
1 [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7]    ← every column of every row goes to all 8 XCDs
2 [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7]    ← XCD 0's work is a vertical stripe of col 0
3 [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7]    ← no 2-D locality anywhere
```

### After `remap_xcd_chunked(CHUNK=4)` + `pid_grid(W=1)`

```
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
0 [0][0][0][0][1][1][1][1]    ← XCD 0 owns a 4-wide horizontal stripe
1 [2][2][2][2][3][3][3][3]    ← good A-row reuse within each XCD's run
2 [4][4][4][4][5][5][5][5]    ← but no B-column reuse (each tile a new col)
3 [6][6][6][6][7][7][7][7]
```

### After `remap_xcd_chunked(CHUNK=4)` + `pid_grid(W=4)` (both phases)

```
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
0 [0][0][1][1][2][2][3][3]    ← XCD 0 owns a tight 4×2 rectangle of tiles
1 [0][0][1][1][2][2][3][3]    ← both A-row AND B-column reuse within XCD
2 [0][0][1][1][2][2][3][3]    ← this is what L2 wants
3 [0][0][1][1][2][2][3][3]
```

The HTML viz lets you toggle each phase and watch the colouring change in real time.

## 5 · Defaults vs sweet spots

| Knob | File default | HK paper sweet spot (9216³ BF16) |
|---|---|---|
| `CHUNK_SIZE` / *C* | **2** | **25** |
| `GROUP_SIZE_M` / *W* | **1** (= row-major) | **5** |

Defaults are "barely-on" so a caller who imports the helpers but forgets to tune doesn't silently regress. The L2-greedy trap (`remap_xcd` alone with W=1) is real: paper measured 14.9 TB/s vs 15.1 TB/s baseline vs 18.3 TB/s balanced.

## 6 · Where these get called (sample)

```
csrc → not relevant
aiter/ops/triton/_triton_kernels/
  gemm/basic/{gemm_a16w16,a8w8,a16w8_blockscale,...}.py
  gemm/feed_forward/ff_a16w16_fused_gated.py
  gemm/fused/fused_gemm_*.py
  moe/{moe_op,moe_op_mxfp4,moe_op_gemm_a4w4,...}.py
  attention/{lean_atten,mla_decode_rope}.py
```

Notable gap: the sparse-MLA 3-D split-K path uses `pid_grid_3d`, which **does not** apply Phase 1 or Phase 2. For low-batch decode this likely scatters the MN slice across XCDs — an unexplored tuning lever flagged in `MEMORY.md` (see [[sparse_mla_3d_split_k_lever]]).

## 7 · Decision rubric for new kernels

```
Does the kernel read input data that could be reused across blocks?
  ├─ No (elementwise op) ────────────────► skip both helpers
  └─ Yes (GEMM / attention / conv)
     │
     ├─ Small problem (a few hundred blocks)
     │  └─ Phase 1 + Phase 2 still help, but marginally
     │
     └─ Big problem (10k+ blocks)
        └─ remap_xcd_chunked + pid_grid, sweep (C, W).
           Start (C, W) ≈ (16, 4) or (32, 8). Watch L2 AND LLC hit
           rate — never sacrifice one for the other. Target the
           bandwidth column, not the hit-rate column.
```
